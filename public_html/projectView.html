					Web based music player system that suggests songs based on the user's emotional state. The system uses computer vision(CV) techniques to detect the user's emotions through facial expressions, and a suitable song is recommended accordingly. Which is already givrn in the dataset.  The proposed system -  process of selecting music based on mood. Detect nearly 6 Emotions like (happy,sad,neutral,calm,angry,surprise), reducing time and effort of user by searching song according to their mood.  The algorithm uses Haar Cascade and CNN algorithms to detect facial expressions and select an appropriate music track. The inbuilt camera reduces system design costs. The system is based on recommender systems, convolutional neural networks, deep learning, image processing, artificial intelligence, and classification.
